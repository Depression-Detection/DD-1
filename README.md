# Overview

In the reddit-cnn-2.py file, we put the comments of Reddit users into a dataframe and "cleaned" the comments for our use. This dataframe contains the comments and the depression status of the commenter gathered from our survey. Next, we use Natural Language Processing and Tensorflow to train a Convulational Neural Network to detect depression. This model is stored in the reddit-cnn-2.zip file.
